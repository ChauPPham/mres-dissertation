		\item The table reports items that are used to construct indices of investment for four different age groups: 0-2, 3-5, 6-9, and 10-14. Items under panel Goods are used to construct Goods index for all present children while items under Time are used to construct Time index only for children under 10. Extra items gathered under the last two panels are also used to construct the generic HOME index and Time index for children between 10-14.
		\item[a] Items prefixed by (NH) are not from HOME but from self-administered survey of children.
