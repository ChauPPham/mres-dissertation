abstract = {This paper reviews the international (non-U.S.) evidence on the benefits of early childhood interventions. A total of 38 contrasts of 30 interventions in 23 countries were analyzed. It focuses on studies applying a quasi-experimental or random assignment. Studies were coded according to: the type of intervention (cash transfer, nutritional, educational or mixed); sample size; study design and duration; country; target group (infants, prekindergarten); subpopulations of interventions; and dosage of intervention. Cohen's D effect sizes were calculated for four outcomes: cognitive gains; behavioral change; health gains; and amount of schooling. We find children from different context and countries receive substantial cognitive, behavioral, health and schooling benefits from early childhood interventions. The benefits are sustained over time. Interventions that have an educational or stimulation component evidenced the largest cognitive effects.}

abstract = {This paper analyzes the effect of childrenâ€™s work on learning achievement. Its particular significance is that it goes beyond the analysis of the effects on school enrollment or attendance by using measures of skills learned in reading and mathematics. The results show that work outside the household has a substantial effect on learning achievement. Although they confirm the accepted wisdom, they introduce a new view of how that arises. A large part of it is direct, and not through school attendance. The direct link could exist because of exhaustion or because of a diversion of interest away from academic concerns.}

We study the age trajectory of risk attitudes all the way from early adulthood until old age, in large representative panel data sets from the Netherlands and Germany. Age patterns are generally difficult to identify separately from cohort or calendar period effects. We achieve identification by replacing calendar period indicators with controls for the specific underlying factors that may change risk attitudes across periods. The main result is that willingness to take risks decreases over the life course, linearly until approximately age 65 after which the slope becomes flatter.}",
