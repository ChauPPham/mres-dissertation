CHRR IS INVESTIGATING THESE DISCREPANCIES. THESE VALUES WERE NOT CHANGED FOR THE
1979-1992 DATA RELEASE. AS A RESULT, THESE HIGH VALUES WERE INCLUDED IN THE

NOTE: FOR VARIABLE CREATION, SEE APPENDIX 2: TOTAL NET FAMILY INCOME TRUNCATED 
VALUES ARE EQUAL TO THE AVERAGE VALUE OF THE TOP 2% OF RESPONDENTS WHO ARE U.S. 
RESIDENTS.  IF THE NUMBER OF TRUNCATED VALUES EXCEEDS THAT WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN
TRUNCATED AT THE TRADITIONAL TRUNCATION LEVEL OF 100,001 FOR THIS ITEM, VALUES 
OVER THAT TRADITIONAL TRUNCATION LEVEL ARE AVERAGED. PERSONS WITH  OUT-OF-RANGE 
CODE 999,996 WERE ASSIGNED THIS VALUE AS AN APPROXIMATION. SINCE PERSONS WITH 
OUT-OF-RANGE CODES HAVE VALUES GREATER THAN THIS CODE, OUR AVERAGE TOP-CODED 
RESPONDENTS WILL BE TOO LOW TO THE EXTENT THAT OUT-OF-RANGE CODES ARE PRESENT IN
THE RAW DATA. OVERSEAS RESPONDENTS WHOSE DOLLAR INCOME COULD NOT BE DETERMINED 
ARE CODED -3.

             WOULD R TAKE JOB THAT COULD EITHER DOUBLE FAMILY INCOME OR CUT 
             INCOME BY 3RD?
 
Now I have another kind of question. Suppose that you are the only income earner
in the family, and you have a good job guaranteed to give you your current 
(family) income every year for life. You are given the opportunity to take a new
and equally good job, with a 50-50 chance that it will double your (family) 
income and a 50-50 chance that it will cut your (family) income by a third. 
Would you take the new job?

             LOWEST PRICE TO SELL $10,000 ITEM BEFORE KNOWING WORTH
 
Suppose you have been given an item that is either worth nothing or worth $10,
000.  Tomorrow you will learn what it is worth.  There is a 50-50 chance it will
be worth $10,000 and a 50-50 chance it will be worth nothing.  You can wait to 
find out how much the item is worth, or you can sell it before its value is 
determined.  What is the lowest price that would lead you to sell the item now 
rather than waiting to see what it is worth?

IF SELF-REPORTED RANGES ARE GIVEN AND (EXAMPLE T09126.00, T09128.00):
*UPPER/LOWER VALUES ARE IN PROPER ORDER, MIDPOINT IS USED;
*RANGES ARE GIVEN BACKWARDS, THE VALUES ARE REVERSED AND MIDPOINT IS USED;
*THE SAME VALUE IS GIVEN FOR UPPER/LOWER SELF-REPORTED RANGE VALUE, THAT SINGLE 
VALUE IS USED;
 
IF UNFOLDING BRACKETS ARE ANSWERED (LOW BRACKET < ENTRY VALUE < HIGH BRACKET) 
AND (EXAMPLE T09129.00-T09131.00):
*R REPORTS LESS THAN ENTRY VALUE AND LESS THAN LOW BRACKET, THEN HALF OF LOW 
BRACKET VALUE IS USED (MIDPOINT BETWEEN LOW BRACKET AND 0)
* R REPORTS LESS THAN ENTRY VALUE BUT GREATER THAN LOW BRACKET VALUE, MIDPOINT 
BETWEEN LOW BRACKET AND ENTRY VALUE IS USED;
*R REPORTS GREATER THAN ENTRY VALUE BUT LESS THAN HIGH BRACKET VALUE, MIDPOINT

Suppose that you are the only income earner in the family, and that you have to 
choose between two new jobs. The first job would guarantee your current total 
family income for life. The second job is possibly better paying, but the income
is also less certain. There is a 50-50 chance the second job would increase your
total lifetime income by 20 percent and a 50-50 change that is would cut it by 
10 percent.
 
Which job would you take: the first job or the second job?

Suppose that you are the only income earner in the family, and that you have to 
choose between two new jobs. The first job would guarantee your current total 
family income for life. The second job is possibly better paying, but the income
is also less certain. There is a 50-50 chance the second job would increase your
total lifetime income by 20 percent and a 50-50 change that is would cut it by 
10 percent.
